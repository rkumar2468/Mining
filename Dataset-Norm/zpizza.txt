It was late so they only had a few options (wish they had more) but the pizza I ended up getting was the vegan Berkley (it was the only vegetarian option they had) but I can tell you it was amazing! Now I'm hooked. I've actually came back several times for it. Who knew that vegan cheese could be so gooey & delicious."},{"Name":"Jennie H.","Place":"KNICKERBOCKER, NY","Rating":"5.0","reviewCount":"6 reviews","friendCount":"0 friends","ReviewComment":"SUPER YUMMY PIZZA!!!!  We haven't had this since we lived in Manassas, VA and were so delighted to find out they have an NYC location that delivers to us in the LES.  Their website is very user friendly and as VEGANS we really appreciate that they show how to make almost ANYTHING on their menu VEGAN!  This includes pizza, salads and calzones.  We ordered the PROVENCE which was so delicious with artichokes, fresh sliced tomatoes, hints of garlic and capers for that extra zing...  with Vegan Daiya cheese of course!  The crust is so good too!  We actually prefer it over another good pizza place, Two Boots.  The delivery was fast and friendly and unlike other reviews we had no problem placing the order over the phone.  I see ZPIZZA becoming a weekly thing in our house!"}],"Address":"26 1st Ave New York, NY 10014","street":"East Village","Reccomended":[{"Name":"Katherine G.","Place":"Claremont, CA","Rating":"4.0","reviewCount":"5 reviews","friendCount":"0 friends","ReviewComment":"I haven't been to this particular zpizza because new york is full of fantastic pizza but I love their pizza and it always was the best in my hometown. Thin crust, fresh ingredients, melty cheese, lots of options. As a southern California native and having very recently made the move for college, I'm very excited to try this out and have a taste of home! I would definitely recommend zpizza to anybody looking for fast, fresh, solid pizza."},{"Name":"Madhu R.","Place":"New York, NY","Rating":"5.0","reviewCount":"448 reviews","friendCount":"44 friends","ReviewComment":"Love this place!  I don't know why there aren't many reviews (probably due to its location and small seating area).  However, this is some of the highest quality by-the-slice pizza places around.  I always get the pepperoni with some extra sauce on the side.  It's super delicious and doesn't feel too heavy afterwards since all the ingredients are very good quality.  The staff is always wonderfully friendly too, and if you can snag a seat, this place has great drunk people watching on 1st ave!"},{"Name":"Hillary F.","Place":"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY","Rating":"2.0","reviewCount":"21 reviews","friendCount":"14 friends","ReviewComment":"It's nice to find a place in the city that has hormone-free, free-ranged poultry, and all their ingredients are said to be organic. The pizza is yummy and they have a creative menu. I do have to say their buffalo wings aren't worth the money. Aim for the pizza. P.s. Calling in your order is close to impossible and they usually give up and hang up on me. Save yourself the trouble, if you are close enough, and stop in."},{"Name":"Cassandra B.","Place":"Brooklyn, NY","Rating":"3.0","reviewCount":"642 reviews","friendCount":"32 friends","ReviewComment":"I used to frequent their old location in the West Village but this is my first time at the location in the East Village. I stopped in for a quick vegan slice, which was fast and cheap, though not as impressive as the slices at Viva Herbal up on 2nd Ave. The guy working was really friendly and fast, so I'll be back."},{"Name":"Eby G.","Place":"New York, NY","Rating":"3.0","reviewCount":"33 reviews","friendCount":"1 friend","ReviewComment":"They have limited vegan options (1) by the slice but if you get a whole pie, it is totally worth it, though a bit on the pricey side. Not as good as the old Bleeker St location but stoked to have them around again, nonetheless. They are quick and convenient."},{"Name":"M K.","Place":"New York, NY","Rating":"4.0","reviewCount":"27 reviews","friendCount":"0 friends","ReviewComment":"Amazing pizza, creative menu. Very difficult to communicate with the employees, and you have to order over the phone because their site doesn't work. It was interesting trying to order the \"Casablanca\" but it was definitely worth the hassle. I will be back."},{"Name":"Sleepy J.","Place":"Brooklyn, NY","Rating":"2.0","reviewCount":"1 review","friendCount":"0 friends","ReviewComment":"great food but horrible service.  you can never understand the employees who work their and they are always out of food. Everytime i call the item i want to order is always out of stock. And they promote delivery but they never have a delivery person. very poorly run business."},{"Name":"Priscilla R.","Place":"FOREST HILLS, NY","Rating":"1.0","reviewCount":"7 reviews","friendCount":"0 friends","ReviewComment":"Their phone skills are TERRIBLE, they have false advertising on their menu because although it states they have delivery service they never do......on 3 separate times they told me they had NO ONE to deliver, so I said \"your menu says you deliver\" and his response was \"yea well we don't have no one, so you gotta pick up\" Other than that the pizza is good. If they had delivery service and proper customer service I would had given them 4 stars."},{"Name":"Jill F.","Place":"New York, NY","Rating":"1.0","reviewCount":"4 reviews","friendCount":"0 friends","ReviewComment":"First of all, this people who answer the phone here have appalling phone manners.  Employ people who speak english to answer your phones. Every time I have called this Lower East Side location, the person on the other end of the line has not understood anything I said and then hung up on me.  Also, the people who answer the phone don't say \"ZPizza\" so you have no idea who you're calling. I finally got through to someone who seemed to speak english to place an order for the \"Tuscan Mushroom\" pizza which is supposed to have truffle oil, caramelized onions, thyme, garlic sauce and a \"mushroom mix\".  The pizza I got had cheese, plain grey mushrooms, and nothing else.  No mix of mushrooms, no onions, no garlic, no truffle oil.  It looked nothing like the beautiful picture of the pizza on their website. Then I ordered a vegan version of the \"Pear Gorgonzola\" salad as advertised on the website here: zpizza.com  - Despite me being very clear about the vegan cheese, of course it came covered in Gorgonzola cheese which means it's not vegan, so I can't eat it.  On top of this the order took almost two hours to arrive when I was told 20 minutes. Really unimpressed.  This place is really sub-par and absolutely not worth the money.  I was planning to order a bunch of pizzas for a party here - I'll be going somewhere else."},{"Name":"Akilesh A.","Place":"Brooklyn, NY","Rating":"5.0","reviewCount":"58 reviews","friendCount":"5 friends","ReviewComment":"This small, very casual slice joint sports delicious fare with inventive toppings. I had a Tuscan slice, which had thyme, truffle oil, feta cheese, caramelized onions, roasted garlic sauce, mozzarella, and cremini and shiitake mushrooms. It was quite tasty.."}]}
